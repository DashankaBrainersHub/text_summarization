      "summarize: en_to_en A robot has been arrested' by Swiss police after it bought a supply of illegal drugs on a hidden region of the internet known as the 'dark net'. The automated computer program was designed as an online shopping system that would spend up to $100 each week by randomly purchasing an item offered for sale on the deep web. The robot would then have its purchase mailed to a group of artists who then put the items in an exhibition in the town of St Gallen, in north east Switzerland. The Random Darknet Shopper purchased a number of items for sale on the deep web (pictured) including trainers, jeans, cigarettes, a set of masterkeys and a DVD case (far left) containing 10 ecstasy tablets . The items it bought included a pair of Nike trainers, counterfeit designer jeans, the scan of a Hungarian passport and a set of UK Fire Brigade masterkeys. However, it seems the Random Darknet Shopper crossed the line when it purchased 10 Ecstasy tablets, which arrived in a vacuum packed bag hidden in a DVD case. The dark net is a subsection of the deep web - the part of the internet that does not show up in searches or on social media. Most of the information on the web is far down on dynamically generated sites, unable to be found or seen by traditional search engines, which are rather like dragging a net across the surface of the sea, missing much of the information in the depths. The dark net is used as a way of sharing information and trading goods, but the anonymous and encrypted nature of it has attracted large amounts of illegal activity. The Silk Road website and its successor that were recently shut down was used to sell drugs in exchange for bitcoins, the electronic currency. Other dark net sites allow users to share pornographic photographs, hacked information, credit card numbers and other illegal goods. The Silk Road used an underground computer network known as the The Onion Router (TOR), which is a matrix of encrypted websites and servers that disguise the identity of users. It uses numerous layers of security and encryption, hiding the IP address and the activity of the user. Just 0.26 per cent of the daily internet traffic from the UK accesses this hidden part of the internet. Police seized the drugs, the computer and the rest of the items it had purchased\n",

      "summarize: en_to_en Nicola Sturgeon will today launch an extraordinary bid to ‘lead the UK’ as she unveils a string of policies apparently tailor-made for a power-sharing deal with Labour. The SNP leader will unveil a manifesto including proposals for British foreign policy, welfare payments, energy bills and English university tuition fees. Several of her election pledges overlap with Labour policy, including slashing tuition fees in England from a maximum of £9,000 a year to £6,000, and rolling back competition in the English NHS. Others are calculated to drag a minority Labour government to the left, including halting the roll-out of Iain Duncan Smith’s popular changes to benefits and cancelling the Trident nuclear weapons system. Scroll down for video . Control: The Tories warn SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon will be Ed Milibands puppet master if he becomes Prime Minister after the election . Several election pledges in Miss Sturgeons manifesto overlap with Labour policy, including slashing tuition fees in England from a maximum of £9,000 a year to £6,000, and rolling back competition in the English NHS . The SNP also wants the UK to formally recognise Palestine as a state, give energy regulator Ofgem the power to force suppliers to cut prices and to increase public spending on infrastructure in northern England and Wales. At the heart of the SNP’s manifesto are plans for what Miss Sturgeon has called ‘modest’ spending increases funded by yet more borrowing – but which in fact total £180billion over five years. Scotland’s First Minister, who is not herself running for a Westminster seat, said yesterday the SNP had much in common with Left-wing Labour MPs and aimed to build a ‘progressive alliance’ for people ‘right across the UK’. ‘There is an opportunity to build progressive alliances for progressive policies. It is a real rather than a pretend alternative to austerity,’ she told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. Today’s SNP election manifesto will be the first to be the focus of intense national scrutiny. Polls suggest the party is on course for a landslide victory north of the border, winning as many as 50 seats and holding the balance of power at Westminster. That could trigger constitutional turmoil of the sort that followed the\n",

Christopher Bridger, 25, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, attacked three women after separate drinking sessions and was jailed for 12 years after being convicted of rape and four other abuse charges last year. The HCPC Conduct and Competence Committee today removed him from the register after hearing his crimes and describing them as a serious breach of trust'. Christopher Bridger, 25, who was jailed for 12 years after he sexually assaulted three women, has been struck off the medical register . A jury at Guildford Crown Court, Surrey, found him guilty of raping a fellow student while he was studying to be a paramedic at St George's University Hospital in London in 2008. He had accompanied her back to her halls following a Freshers' Week fancy dress party and began kissing and cuddling her, despite being told to stop. He then raped her but astonishingly broke down in tears afterwards and said: 'I just want to like girls.' The woman told the jury she ended up comforting Bridger, despite knowing he was in the wrong. His other victims were co-workers at South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Trust, where he started working in 2010. A lesbian colleague told the court she was molested by Bridger after a staff Christmas party while her girlfriend was in the same hotel bed. The HCPC Conduct and Competence Committee found his crimes were a 'serious breach of trust' The women, aged in their 20s - who cannot be named for legal reasons - were forced to relive their ordeals after the ambulance worker accused them of lying during a trial in July last year. His colleague explained how Bridger came up to her hotel room after she got extremely intoxicated at the party in December 2011. He climbed into bed between his victim and her partner and the woman awoke to find him sexually assaulting her and pleasuring himself as her girlfriend lay asleep next to them. She kept quiet, fearing her partner wouldn't understand what had happened, but the day after on his birthday, he sheepishly sent the woman a number of text messages apologising\n",

      "summarize: en_to_en A teacher has been banned from the classroom after he let pupils change their exam answers invalidating his whole schools SATs results. Ian Guffick asked pupils to make changes to the the national curriculum tests for 11-year-olds, which assess English, maths and science at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewskesbury, Gloucestershire. This was despite the exam session finishing, a conduct panel heard. Ian Guffick asked pupils at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewkesbury, pictured, to make the changes to their SATs exam answers . The 31-year-old also altered a number of the pupil's exam answers himself before the papers were sent off. After the suspected breach of exam rules, school officials were tipped off, resulting in an investigation being launched in June. The probe by the local education authority found that some pupils taking a test had changed answers outside exam conditions and that Guffick had done the same. It then led to the Department for Education annulling all SATs exam results for the entire school last year, the hearing was told. Guffick was later forced to give up his job at the school and had since admitted the allegations and accepted it amounted to unacceptable professional conduct. The Department for Education annulled the whole school's SAT's results after a probe by the local education authority (file picture) However, he insisted in a statement that he did not ask the pupils to change their answers, but to make them more legible. But the panel, run by the National College for Teaching and Leadership, said that no changes of any kind should be made to exam scripts outside test conditions. Panel chair Martin Pilkington said, although the teacher’s conduct had been dishonest, it fell short of fraud or serious dishonesty. But he added: 'Whilst the panel accepts that Mr Guffick may have felt under pressure to achieve good results for himself and the school, that can in no way excuse his behaviour. 'It is clear to the panel that he deeply regrets his conduct and the panel also considered that he was forthcoming in explaining what he had done when it was investigated by the school and local authority.' Paul Heathcote, acting on behalf of Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, banned Guffick from the classroom\n",

Lineham scored a treble in a losing cause at Castleford last month but his efforts on Friday night settled a drab contest at the KC Stadium. The 22-year-old winger showed good opportunism and no little speed on two occasions to pluck passes out of the air and race over 90 metres to add to his early opener. The hat-trick puts him out in front as Super Leagues most prolific finisher in 2015. Tom Lineham scored two interception tries in an eye-catching hat-trick as Hull FC beat Widnes 22-8 . Jamie Shaul went over late on to make sure of the two competition points for Hull, with tries from Kevin Brown and Patrick Ah Van unable to prevent Widnes from falling to a fifth away defeat out of five. It was a third match in nine days for both sides, although Widnes had reason to feel more hard done by after their Easter Monday trip to Catalans. Ah Van had an early opportunity to give the Vikings an extra spring in their step but a foot in touch saw his effort ruled out, although Rhys Hanbury's pass was forward in any case. There was no doubt when Lineham slid over in the corner at the other end after Shaul had spun out of a tackle and found his winger with a nice cut-out pass. The Vikings were defending doggedly near their own line to prevent a second Hull try when Stefan Marsh and Chris Dean were both forced off following a sickening clash of heads. Lineham had a good chance to lay the platform for another Hull raid following a break down the right but his pass was intercepted by former Black and Whites hooker Aaron Heremaia. Widnes worked their way downfield and were back level when Brown, whose high kick in the build-up appeared to have gone forward off Ah Van, forced the ball down from dummy half. The Vikings lost a third player as Lloyd White hobbled off, but they thought they had edged in front when\n",

Englishman Willett vented his anger after his second shot from beyond the green trickled all the way across the putting surface and left the preachers son facing a bogey or worse. 'Of anyone you should know the rules,' Willett shouted loudly at the official, who was sitting about 60 yards away in a golf cart, outside the gallery ropes. Danny Willett waits to play a shot on the fifth during the first round at 2015 Masters on Thursday . The 27-year-old Englishman carded a one-under 71 during his first ever round at Augusta . Willett was still visibly angry as he left the green after salvaging a bogey, though he had calmed down by time he spoke to reporters about 30 minutes later. He said his ire had been raised because the official had been in his line-of-sight as he was preparing to play his shot. 'We were being timed (for slow play), which I can appreciate,' Willett said after carding a one-under 71 at Augusta National. 'It's a little bit tricky out here, so it takes a little bit of time, but you'd like to think the referee that's timing you knows exactly where to put his buggy and where not to put his buggy.

      "summarize: en_to_en Obese workers are lazy' and 'unable to fulfil their roles' and as a result are less likely to be hired, a new survey has revealed. Almost half of 1,000 British companies questioned said they are less inclined to recruit an applicant after interview if they are obese or overweight. Among the reasons given were that overweight workers 'are unable to play a full role in the business', 'they're lazy', and 'they wouldn't be able to do the job required', the research shows. Beverley Sunderland, managing director, at Crosslands Employment Solicitors, who commissioned the research, said: 'Our research shows that prejudiced attitudes towards hiring obese workers are rife among British employers.' A survey of 1,000 British companies revealed almost half are less inclined to recruit an obese applicant, fearing 'they're lazy', and 'unable to fulfil their roles as required', because of their weight . The findings come in the wake of a European court case brought by unions and lawyers on behalf of 25st childminder Karsten Kaltoft, 50, who claimed he was sacked by his local authority in Denmark in 2010 for being too fat. In December European judges ruled that obesity qualified as a disability if it 'hinders the full and effective participation of the person... on an equal basis with other workers', when doing their job. Body Mass Index, calculated from a person's weight and height, is accepted as a reliable indicator of obesity. According to the World Health Organisation, the ideal BMI for most adults is between 18.5 and 24.9. If a person's BMI is 25 to 29.9, they are classed as overweight. At between 30 and 39.9 they are obese and 40 or over is very – or morbidly – obese. Doctors say being overweight or obese can increase the risk of health problems, including heart disease, strokes, type 2 diabetes and some cancers. Earlier this year the European Court of Justice's advocate general, Niilo Jaaskinen, who advises the court, suggested that very severe obesity – classified as a BMI of more than 40 – could be considered a disability.

The families of victims of Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe are furious at plans to move him from Broadmoor to a low-security Priory unit. Mass murderer Sutcliffe has spent more than three decades in Broadmoor for the savage killings of 13 women. But now, despite being one of the country’s most notorious serial killers, Sutcliffe may be moved to a cushy Priory unit set in Berkshire woodland. Sutcliffe is being lined up for the move after he expressed remorse and said he no longer hears the voices from God' which he had blamed for his killing spree at his 1981 trial. A report is being compiled which will be heard next month at a prison tribunal which will rule if the move goes ahead. But families of his victims are furious about the move. Neil Jackson, whose mother Emily, 46, became the Ripper's second victim in 1976, told the Sun: 'He should not be moved at all. 'As he's in Broadmoor, he should stay there and they should throw away the key. This just rubs salt into the wounds of families and I believe any remorse he has shown is fake.' A source at the prison told the newspaper Sutcliffe was optimistic about the move - despite being previously turned down for a transfer to the unit which boasts facilities such as a fully-fitted gym and music room. Plans of his referral follow allegations earlier this year that Sutcliffe, who used weapons including a hammer, screwdriver and knives to mutilate women across the north of England, was enjoying an easy lifestyle in jail.

Chris Appleton, who has been working with natural brunette Rita, 24, for the past two years, confessed to Daily Mail Online that her demanding haircare routine does require a hefty amount of work and 'maintenance'. 'We have to color the hair every three weeks,' he explained. 'We've managed to get the timing perfect so that she's not coloring it all the time.

'I also make my own hair masks, which I make her sleep in, to ensure that her hair stays in the best condition possible. 'I'm so strict with Rita, I want to make sure that her hair always looks great, and that means a lot of work. When she has any spare time, I make her condition.' But despite the seemingly endless hours of maintenance required in order to keep Rita's barnet looking its best, Chris insists that the singer isn't planning to follow in Kim Kardashian's footsteps and make a change to brunette any time soon. 'Blonde is such a statement, despite the fact that it's a lot of maintenance behind the scenes,' he said. 'We've never done anything deep or dark and we change the actual style so much that I'm eager to keep the color consistent.'

      "article: summarize: en_to_en The baby boom generation is set to leave a wave of funeral debt to its children and grandchildren, a report warns. The number of deaths every year in Britain – which have been falling for the past 40 years – will rise by 20 per cent over the next two decades, as the lives of unprecedented numbers born in the post-baby boom come to an end. At the same time the price of a funeral is rising fast, thanks to higher costs for cremation, rising undertakers’ bills as funeral firms are faced with bad debts, and the increasing fees demanded by churches. Loss of baby boomers: The number of UK deaths per will rise by 20 per cent over the next two decades, as funeral costs have already risen by 80 per cent over the past ten years . The report, prepared by an old age think tank, the International Longevity Centre-UK, and backed by insurance firm OneFamily, suggests that younger people who already feel financially hard pressed in comparison to their parents will still be under money pressure even after their deaths. Younger people are finding it increasingly difficult to afford homes or to start families, and in the long-term their pensions are much less secure than those of their parents, many of whom enjoyed the generous and fast-disappearing defined benefit pension system. The report from ILC-UK to be published next week said that death rates are set to go up following a long period in which medical advances, better diet, healthier lifestyles and the growing unpopularity of smoking, and the decline of dangerous heavy industrial jobs, have meant fewer people have been dying despite a rising population. ‘After decades of the number of deaths in the UK falling, 2015 will mark a tipping point where the historic trend starts to reverse,’ it said. ‘As the oldest of the baby boomer generation move through their later years, deaths are predicted to rise by 20 per cent.’ Expensive end: A ‘simple’ funeral, with a cremation, a minister and an undertaker, now costs an average of £3,590, an old age think tank has found . It added: ‘This will have significant implications for current forecasts of funeral costs and highlights a growing need for families to broach the delicate subject of end of life expenses.’ Baroness Sally Greengros\n",

      "article: summarize: en_to_en (CNN)A photo of a baby boy being pulled from the rubble of the Nepal earthquake has become the defining image of a disaster that has devastated the country. His tiny face is coated in dust from the debris that crashed around him as the earth shook on Saturday, April 25, killing more than 5,000 people and injuring at least twice as many more. His name is Sonit Awal, and hes just four months old. On Saturday, Sonit was at home in Muldhoka, Bhaktapur, east of the capital Kathmandu, when the 7.8-magnitude quake sent tremors through Nepal and neighboring countries, according to Kathmandu Today. The house collapsed, burying the child, leaving his father Shyam Awal frantically searching for him amid the rubble. A desperate Awal called the Nepalese Army, and they too scrambled through the dirt and debris until midnight, before giving up hope and leaving. Sonit's father had lost all hope of finding his son alive, the paper reported, until he heard faint cries from below. On Sunday morning, the soldiers returned and at 10 a.m they lifted Sonit clear of the fallen rocks, beams, bricks and dust that had trapped him for 22 hours. His rescuers held him high in their hands to the sun, though his eyes were still wedged tightly shut. Sonits face was exposed during the whole ordeal, though a hooded top and shawl protected his head and body during the cold night spent under rubble. The baby was taken to Bhaktapur Hospital and found to be uninjured; . His unlikely rescue provides some hope to a country that has experienced so much loss.\n",

      "article: summarize: en_to_en (CNN)Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, was once known as the murder capital of the world. Back in 2010, at the height of cartel violence, the city averaged 8.5 killings per day. But five years later, local officials say the city is much safer, and plans are underway to lure foreign tourists and investors back to Juarez. This month the city launched the tourism campaign \"Juarez is Waiting for You.\" The rebranding effort started quietly a year ago, and on April 10, it was on full display. Mayor Enrique Serrano officially kicked off the campaign, giving what he called an \"unprecedented\" high-profile tour to regional leaders from the United States and Mexico. U.S. Rep. Robert \"Beto\" ORourke of Texas was one of those on a leg of the Juarez tour. His congressional district includes El Paso, Texas, which sits directly across the Rio Grande. O'Rourke says there's good reason for locals to be hopeful. \"As a region, El Paso and Juarez represent 20% of all U.S-Mexico trade. The binational ties are strong and have remained strong,\" O'Rourke says. \"Yes, we had a really difficult time for a ... period. Juarez was at one time the deadliest city in the world.\" O'Rourke speaks of a time between 2009 and 2012 when men, women and children were killed indiscriminately. Many were helplessly caught in the cartel violence. Others were victims of the drug turf war. It wasn't that long ago, O'Rourke says, that he thought twice about crossing the bridge into Juarez. \"(Now) I travel to Juarez regularly to have lunch or meet people or just to go. I always feel safe and secure.\" A spokesman for the Chihuahua state attorney general's office told CNN that at one point, there were days when Juarez had more than 20 killings. \"That was normal,\" spokesman Julio Castaneda told CNN. \"It's safer now.\" The numbers from the attorney general's office seem to bear that out.

      "article: summarize: en_to_en Between the bad behaviour and the bad advice, Raheem Sterling is not exactly endearing himself to potential suitors right now. Hippy crack and shisha pipes, mixed in with accusations of greed after being encouraged by his agent to reject Liverpool’s offer of close to £100,000-a-week, might not be quite enough to send rival clubs running. After all, as Liverpool know only too well, you can bite and racially abuse opponents and still secure a move to Barcelona. But the evidence is sure to be a concern when the world’s richest clubs assess the character as much as the class of an individual before parting with the £40million upwards Liverpool will demand to secure the services of a player like Sterling. Liverpool players Raheem Sterling and Jordon Ibe (left) have been pictured smoking a shisha pipe . This is the second time Sterling has been pictured smoking from a shisha pipe in the past few days . The recent images of Sterling will be a concern to clubs considering parting with £40million to sign the star . Luis Suarez secured a move to Barcelona despite being involved in a number of incidents on the pitch . English football would appear to have yet another flawed talent, another player seemingly lacking the wit to make best use of the ability he has been blessed with. There is a reason why we rarely see the finest players on the planet caught in as compromising a position as Sterling found himself on Monday night. Becoming as good as Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo — Gareth Bale even — requires more than ability alone. It requires the kind of professionalism and dedication that seems to be absent in English players too often photographed smoking or indulging in legal highs. As the latest photographs show, this is not an isolated incident and he will be lectured on the dangers of nitrous oxide when he meets with Brendan Rodgers tomorrow. It is more of a health issue than an image issue for Liverpool’s manager, as Sterling did at least opt for the privacy of his own home to suck on a balloon filled with nitrous oxide — unlike Tottenham’s Kyle Walker, for instance.

      "article: summarize: en_to_en Muhammad Naviede, 60, (pictured outside the Old Bailey in 1995) was killed instantly in a plane crash . A banking fraudster with links to Cherie Blair was killed instantly in a plane crash minutes after he sent a text saying his aircraft was going down, an investigation has revealed. Muhammad Naviede, who was jailed in 1995 for nine years for a £45million fraud, died after his Piper Tomahawk aircraft plummeted into a field near Padbury in Buckinghamshire. The 60-year-old, whose daughter is a former X-Factor contestant, sent a text to a relative shortly before the crash on August 20 last year saying: I'm in a plane out of control and it's going down.' An investigation by the Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) said the message was 'unusual' as the leased plane did not enter a spin until after it was sent. The experienced pilot had also tried to call the same relative before writing 148 characters within 25 seconds in a text - something the AAIB said would require 'considerable dexterity'. The report said: 'The pilot had accumulated considerable experience in a variety of aircraft in the years that he had been flying. He was familiar with the Piper Tomahawk aircraft and was in recent flying practice. 'It was suggested in his final text message that he had lost control of the aircraft, to such an extent that he did not expect to survive. 'However, after this message was sent, the aircraft continued in flight for more than two minutes, before entering a spin from which it did not recover.' Investigators found no fault with the aircraft and said weather conditions were unlikely to have caused the crash. Mr Naviede, of Regent's Park, London, had previously undertaken aerobatic training, meaning he 'would have recognised, and been able to recover from, a spin', according to the AAIB. The investigation also revealed the father-of-two had not booked a final destination for the fatal flight.
